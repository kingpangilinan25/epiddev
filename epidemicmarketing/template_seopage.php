		<h2 class="text-center">What exactly IS SEO?</h2>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Simply stated, SEO is ANY activity that attempts to improve your website's rank in the search engines.</strong> There are many different factors that go into a successful SEO campaign including:</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Keyword Research</strong><br/>
					This is possibly the most important step in the entire process, because if you don't know what keywords are actually being searched for you won't know how to develop your strategy.

				<span class="icon-fl"><img src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/images/seopage/icon-what-seo-3.png" title="target" alt="target" width="44" height="38" /></span>
				<p>
					<strong>On Page SEO</strong><br/>
					This is the technical side of things. Basically it is making sure that your website is set up correctly with all the right coding and design elements to ensure the search engines can find your site and understand what it is about.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Off Page Optimization</strong><br/>
					Off page optimization involves optimizing all of the elements that are not directly on your website. This can include content marketing, citation building, link building and more. The more high quality and relevant websites that list your business information or link back to your website the more Google and the other search engines will trust your website. We spend hours and hours combing the web and making sure that only the best sites and the right sites are influencing your rankings.

					<h3>Why Does SEO Give a Better Return on Investment (ROI) Than Traditional Marketing?</h3>
					<p>When you advertise with radio, television or other types of "traditional advertising" you are using what's called a shotgun approach. You put your message in front of a large number of people and you hope that a small percentage are interested. An even smaller percentage will look at your product or service and an even smaller percentage will actually buy. This is not the case with SEO. SEO brings highly targeted traffic to your business resulting in more sales or conversions. Search Engine Optimization brings your website to people that are ALREADY looking for your services.</p>

					<h3>What is Highly Targeted Traffic? How Does it Help My Business?</h3>
					<p>Targeted traffic is people who are already looking for the service or product that you provide. SEO brings you traffic that is 4 times more likely to convert into a sale than traditional marketing methods. Quality SEO enables you to show up as a trusted professional in the search results to people who are looking for your business, service, or product. Not only does SEO bring you a higher return on investment it is less costly than traditional marketing. Epidemic Marketing is able to not only bring you traffic to your website but we can bring you traffic that matters, traffic that wants to convert into real world sales.</p>

					<h3>What is a Conversion? What Does My Website Have to do With Conversions?</h3>
					<p>It isn't going to help you to have an extra 5000 visitors to your website each month unless they are taking your desired action, or as we call it "converting". Think of a conversion as the "ching" from your cash register. It could be a phone call from the customer, an email or the purchase of a product. A well thought out digital campaign will optimize or set up your layout to increase conversions. This is a continual process that gets monitored as the digital marketing landscape changes rapidly. If your website does not keep up with changes in Internet marketing conversions can drop off.</p>
